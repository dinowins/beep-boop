## Description

_This is a translator website that takes numeric values and converts numbers to certain messages if they contain certain values. Employers, friends, family, and the rest of the Internet are free to browse through my projects and the source code._

Input: "4" Output: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4"

*_Spec 2: The program should show a new result when the user enters a new number_

*_Spec 3: The program returns "Beep!" for all numbers that contain a 1_

Input: "10"
Output: "0", "Beep!", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "Beep!"

*_Spec 4: The program returns "Boop!" for all numbers that contain a 2 (including numbers that include 1s and 2s together)_

Input: "10" Output: "0", "Beep!", "Boop!", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "Beep!"

*_Spec 5: The program returns "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that" for all numbers that contain a 3 (including numbers that include 1s, 2s, and 3s together)_
